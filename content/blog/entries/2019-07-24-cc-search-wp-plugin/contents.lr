#### Inspiration and idea for the WordPress plugin

Back in May, I read a blog post about the new Creative Commons search tool CC Search. My colleagues in CTI **<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>** and I were fascinated by its searching power.
Inspired by this new CC tool, we began thinking, how we could use it, into the Greek School Network’s**<sup><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>** blogging platform <https://blogs.sch.gr>**<sup><a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup>** - a WordPress multisite installation, free for all Greek teachers, students, and Greek school units.

We decided to make a WordPress plugin, which would “harvest” the images from the Creative Commons Catalog API, in a similar way [CC Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) does, but without the need for the user to leave the WordPress post editor. The plugin should allow the execution of “search, select and import image and CC license data” into the post, while the author was still in WordPress edit page.

#### Our WordPress plugin

After a while, our plugin was ready. Its temporary name is “WP CC Search plugin”. It is a WordPress plugin for searching millions of CC-licensed images while the user is still in the post edit page. He/she can select a CC licensed image and insert it into the post content or set as post-featured image very quickly.

The plugin’s features are:  
- Works in WordPress editor and add a button above the content text area and into the “Add Media” pop-up window.
- Via a pop-up window, allows searching through millions of images using Creative Commons Catalog API power.
- Allows filtering by a provider
- Paginated results
- Quick insert original image or thumbnail with a link to the image URL
- Use image as a featured image for the blog post
- WPML compatible
- Multisite compatible
- Translation ready (it’s already translated in Greek)
- Tested up to WordPress 5.2 with Classic Editor plugin

As intended, we already use the plugin in <https://blogs.sch.gr>, which hosts more than 50.000 blogs. The plugin is available to all its blogs and users since middle May, who has been using it without any issues reported yet.

#### How it works

The plugin needs the WordPress [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) plugin in order to work for WP 5+.

After the plugin’s activation, when the user writes a post, an **“Image with CC licence”** button is added above the post editor area and as an option into the “Add Media” pop-up window.

By pressing the button, a pop-up window allows the user to search using Latin characters for an image.

The user can browse the returned images, preview an image and its license and adjust the image settings:  
- use of thumbnail or original image
- set the image link (if any)
- insert the image into the post or as the featured image

After the user selects an image and insert it, into the post, the image code along with its licensing data is pasted into the post body and the user can continue writing the blog post.

#### Some technical details

The plugin uses AJAX requests to communicate with https://api.creativecommons.engineering and get responses in JSON format.

Only 2 AJAX requests are sent to <https://api.creativecommons.engineering>.  
1. <https://api.creativecommons.engineering/statistics/image?format=json>, for getting the providers list. Then the JSON response is used as select options, for the provider’s dropdown menu.
2. A call to <https://api.creativecommons.engineering/image/search> with the necessary parameters for searching for images based on the given words and the selected provided.

The JSON results, are then transformed via jQuery to images and show up into the popup window. When the user selects an image, jQuery creates a complete HTML <div> tag with all the image info and auto add it into the post editor area or executed the WordPress code to use in as featured image.

#### Still to do

There are still some things that we want to add/change into the plugin and any help on building them is welcome.  
- Find a different plugin name :-). We believe that the plugin’s name should change since it is not an “official” CC commons plugin.
- Currently, the plugin needs the Classic Editor plugin in order to work for WP 5+. A main goal is to make it Gutenberg compatible. 
- Add Multiple images select support
- Add Multi-select options for filtering: providers
- Add select options for filtering: licenses, creator
- Find an icon for the 'Image via CC Search' editor button
- Add plugin’s Info page

#### Code and test site

- You can find and fork the plugin’s code at: <https://github.com/lenasterg/wp_ccsearch>.
- You can test the plugin functionality at <http://users.sch.gr/stergatu/wordpress/> by login via <http://users.sch.gr/stergatu/wordpress/wp-login.php> as username: `testuser` password: `testuser`.


#### Credits

- The plugin is inspired and based on the <https://search.creativecommons.org/> and it couldn’t be possible without the Creative Commons Catalog API <https://api.creativecommons.engineering/#tag/image> which is the engine.
- Most of the plugin's code is based on the WP Pexels <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pexels/> code by WPclever.net
- Pointer's code is based on <https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/integrating-with-wordpress-ui-admin-pointers--wp-26853>
