CC Vocabulary has really come into its own over the last couple of weeks. Here
are some of the newest additions to the CC Vocabulary thesaurus of components.

Tokens now have i18n enabled.

There's also a new table component. It's still under active development as of
now.

### Future

CC Vocabulary is much more mature now than it was at the time of writing my last 
blog. It has a much more stable codebase and a larger collection of polished
components. So if you are a developer of CC apps, I would recommend you use some
of its offerings in your latest project.

CC Vocabulary is out now, with its code, design and translations on GitHub and a
live styleguide hosted on GitHub pages. Please [check it
out](https://creativecommons.github.io/cc-vocabulary/) and join the discussions.
Since it is too early to even call it a beta, your feedback is crucial in shaping
its future and with it, the future of all Creative Commons apps.

Here's a sneak peek!

CC Vocabulary is my GSoC 2019 project under the guidance of [Hugo
Solar](https://creativecommons.org/author/hugocreativecommons-org/) and [Sophine
Clachar](https://creativecommons.org/author/sclachar/). Although not officially
a mentor [Kriti
Godey](https://creativecommons.org/author/kriticreativecommons-org/) has also
been really supportive and helpful.
