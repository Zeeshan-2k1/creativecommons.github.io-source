These is the final blog of my internship with CC. I am working on improving the accessibility of cc-search and internationalizing it as well.
This blog is the conclusion of my work. These past 10 weeks with CC have taught me a lot and I am really grateful to have got this opportunity.
The experience was just amazing and the poeple are so helpful I really enjoyed working with them and am looking forward to continue working with the CC team.
