**Damn.**

Hi, it's me again. It's been long since I last sat down to write. I haven't been
punctual with my posts and my only hope of redemption is that my punctuality
with code makes up for it somehow.

With GSoC deadlines drawing to a close, it makes sense to have a post describing
the fruits of this quarter-year of labour. Let's start with two big news pieces.

If this feels like a self-congratulatory piece patting myself on the back, I 
apologise. It's also my GSoC final submission work product report.

### 🎉 Vocabulary is ready for consumption!

It's been that way for almost a couple of weeks, actually. I just wasn't able to
take time out for a blog post.

The rate at which Vocabulary components have received compatibility-breaking
changes has continuously gone down week after week. Code has been refactored,
_yes_. Stylesheets have been cleaned up, _yes_. Documentation has been updated
and at times even rewritten, _yes_. But in terms of functionality, the
components are stable and solid enough to act as a foundation for the apps to
come. The external API for the components has matured considerably.

It's been about twelve weeks since the first commit to CC Vocabulary way back in
May. As with everything else in software, Vocabulary has moved fast. Under the
mentorship of [Hugo Solar](/blog/authors/hugosolar/) and over the course of
**300+ commits** and **17+ alpha releases**, Vocabulary has gone from 1
component that just said _"Hello World!"_ to **over 33 components** that are
capable of replacing over half the entire codebase of the frontend for CC
Search. Talk about kids growing fast!

You get all the components a typical web application needs, and then some. It's
got the standards like `InputField` and `Button`, some unconventional ones like
`Definition` and `Quote`, and some components that only our own tailored design
library could afford like `Header` and `Footer`.

Here's a list and [there's](https://creativecommons.github.io/cc-vocabulary) 
a living styleguide.

Vocabulary also offers some Stylus mixins, token collection in Stylus, SASS and 
JSON and some handy utils too. That's about it.

I know what you are thinking and _yes, all of that, including
the designs and revisions, was accomplished in two months and a half_.

#### Quality

The code follows the [Standard code style](https://standardjs.com/) and the [Vue
official style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/). In addition,
Vocabulary has [its own style
guide](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/cc-vocabulary/#/Vocabulary/Code%20style)
that has rules right down to the order of rules in the CSS. This ensures that
code is sensibly written, easily understandable and as little in debt as
possible. 

#### Usage

CC Vocabulary can be installed via `npm` and used with a build process...

```
$ npm install @creativecommons/vocabulary
```

...or used directly in the browser inside `script` tags.

```
<script type="text/javascript"
        src="https://unpkg.com/@creativecommons/vocabulary"></script>
```

Even JS is optional (may break in some cases, horrifying so).

```
<link rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
      href="https://unpkg.com/@creativecommons/vocabulary/vocabulary.css">
```

#### Demo

Of course I'm not going to hype you up and leave you hanging! Here's a pen to
show you what's possible. Actually, since the pen uses the UMD version, what it
shows is the lower end of what's possible.

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="result" data-user="dhruvkb" data-slug-hash="dxRJYV" data-preview="true" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CC Vocabulary UMD demo">

#### Contributions invited

Also to make the repository friendlier to incoming developers a number of issues
have been dug out, reported and labelled. This provides incomers, like myself
three months ago, a channel to familiarise themselves with the codebase well
before Outreachy and the next Summer of Code.

The proposal listed a number of components to be developed as a part of the 
program. Over twice that number of components have been implemented.

_In other news..._

### 🎉 Search is largely integrated with Vocabulary!

This was the subordinate goal of my Summer of Code proposal. Surprisingly
enough, once the components were ready it was only a matter of finding code in
CC Search's frontend and swapping it out with Vocabulary components. _Oh, the
tests have pained me so._ Literally every single test broke down and had to be
manually updated.

The end result of the toil under the guidance and review of [Breno
Ferreira](http://localhost:5000/blog/authors/brenoferreira/) is a search
experience that **feels polished** and **looks beautiful** and **works
elegantly**. It also enables another **half a billion** people to use the
platform and sets the groundwork to take that number higher.

The bundle size is lower and code manageability is higher thanks to decoupling
of low level components from the high level experience. Can you ask for more?
How about more consistent icons?

The least I can do is attach screenshots of the new CC Search to give you a 
sneak peek into what Creative Commons apps, starting with Search of course, will
look like in the future. These are screenshots, _not mockups_.

#### Sneak peek

    <figcaption>
      <em>A very minor change to the homepage...</em>
    </figcaption>

    <img src="homepage_hi.png"/>
    <figcaption>
      <em>...is a door to a new world of possibilities.</em>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Yes, CC Search has largely also been translated to Hindi, making it accessible
to the Internet-savvy chunk of the half a billion people who speak the language
in the country with the second-largest Internet enabled populace (first if you
factor in democracy and freedom).

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <figure>
    <img src="about.png"/>
    <figcaption>
      <em>Statistics were never this beautiful...</em>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <figure>
    <img src="collections.png"/>
    <figcaption>
      <em>...and neither were collections.</em>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

These pages too have been internationalised.

Did you spot the new icons? I made a choice to adopt Font Awesome for Vocabulary
as it is a modern, scalable and lightweight alternative to finding a cohesive
set of icons from the trove of the Noun Project and bundling them ourselves.
Plus Font Awesome provides Vue components! What's not to like.

#### Status

I'm not sure if there is enough time in the GSoC period for the integration PR
to be reviewed and merged but I'm not going anywhere and neither are you. You
can follow the integration as it happens
[here](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/pull/413).

If you're enthusiastic you can clone the branch and run the setup on your 
machine. Experience it for yourself, how about that?

#### GSoC work product

**Repository:** https://github.com/dhruvkb/cccatalog-frontend/

**PR**: https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/pull/413/

**Commits:** https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/pull/413/commits

The proposal aimed to replace a lot of indigenous components with Vocabulary
counterparts. Internationalisation and a consistent icon system are just me
going above and beyond.

### 😴 TL;DR?

Summarising, [CC Vocabulary](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-vocabulary)
is now mature and [is getting
married](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/pull/413) to [CC
Search](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-vocabulary). GSoC was a successful
matchmaker.

### ❤️ Postremo

_"I think... I feel good about it."_

GSoC has been a thoroughly refreshing, enriching and educating experience.
Without a shred of doubt I am taking away a lot from this exercise (notably, the
knowledge of the existence of CSS custom properties). My only hope is that I
have given back a comparable amount of output to the community that gave an
outsider like me a chance to work on something this impactful in the long-term.

I can't wait to continue my journey post-GSoC and see what the core team and
the next batch of interns creates for, and using, Vocabulary.

GSoC may be over, but **CC and I have a long way to go**.
