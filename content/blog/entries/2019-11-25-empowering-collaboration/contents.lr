In the past few months I have been privileged to attend [Wikimania
2019][wikimania2019] and the Google Summer of Code [2019 Mentor
Summit][gsoc2019summit]. At these events I was overwhelmed with the amount of
care and effort people are putting into their projects and communities.

At Wikimania 2019, I was impressed with how much overlap there is between the
Creative Commons and Wikimedia communities. Both communities are actively
engaged in expanding the content and participation in the commons--in the
collection and communities empowered by open content. I have a lot of hope in
what existing and future collaborations will allow. At the conference, I got to
see just the tip of the iceberg representing volunteers’ work across the globe.
I hope we at Creative Commons can continue to keep the demands of our daily
workloads in perspective and increase collaboration with the global effort.

At the GSoC 2019 Mentor Summit I was able to attend a good number of sessions
on increasing and maintaining participation. Based on the session discussions
and the work already being done by other organizations, I expect we’ll pursue
the following strategies:

- Improved support for first timers--people who are engaging with code
  repositories for the first time

  - Improve tagging of issues
  - Dedicated documentation

- Improve support for GSoC and Outreachy program applicants

  - Provide application templates

- Participate in social media networks to actively recruit groups who are
  underrepresented in FOSS (free and open source software)
- Collect anonymous demographic data 

A couple of organization examples:

- Public Lab: [Community toolbox][communitytoolbox]
- Python Software Foundation: [Python GSoC – Home][pythongsoc]

Thank you to the community and the work you’re doing <3
