about:
Frederic Font is a post-doc researcher at the Music Technology Group (MTG) of the Department of Information and Communication Technologies of Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. Frederic Font holds a degree in Telecommunications Engineering from Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (2007) and a MSc in Sound and Music Computing from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (2010). In 2015, he obtained a PhD in Sound and Music Computing from Universitat Pompeu Fabra. His research interests lay in the field of sound and music computing, audio processing and the semantic representation of audio content, motivated by the creative potential that online communities of users have through online sound sharing sites such as Freesound. His current research is focused on understanding how to analyze and describe large sound collections so that these become more useful in creative contexts. This includes the use of a wide range of techniques from signal processing and machine learning to semantic representation of music information and analysis of user communities and their generated metadata. In the MTG, Frederic also leads the Freesound website and its related projects, and has coordinated the EU funded AudioCommons project.
