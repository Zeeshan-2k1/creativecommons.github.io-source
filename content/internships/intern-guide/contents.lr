## Post-Announcement

Internship announcements have been made and you've been selected! Congratulations! Here's what we expect you to do before the internship officially starts:

* Continue to refine your project plan and timeline with your mentors.
* Define communication channels and set up a weekly check-in with your mentor.
* Set up your computer and development environment.
* Familiarize yourself with the development process at Creative Commons (pull requests, code review).
* Introduce yourself to the members of CC's engineering team.

## Internship Period

Once the internship starts, here's what we expect of you:

* Work 30-40 hours per week (or agree on a different plan with your mentor ahead of time).
* Push code to GitHub frequently. Commit early and often.
* Be available on Slack whenever you are working and post at least once a (work)day to talk about what you're working on that day.
* Write a short update on your work **every two weeks** and post it to the CC technical blog ([instructions are here](/community/write-a-blog-post/)). To get a sense of how these posts are written and how the projects evolved, you can read entries done by previous [Outreachy](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/categories/outreachy/) or [Google Summer of Code](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/blog/categories/gsoc/) interns.
* Attend your weekly check-in with your mentor and any other meetings.
* Be proactive about asking for help, especially when you're stuck.
* Ensure that you're on track to delivering your project at the end of the work period. If you're not on track, talk with your mentor to come up with a new plan for the project well before the deadline.
* Let your mentor and the organization admins know when you are going to be unavailable. If something sudden comes up, let us know.

## At all times

Follow our [Code of Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct/).
