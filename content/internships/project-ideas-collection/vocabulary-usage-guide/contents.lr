title: Vocabulary usage guide
---
problem:
[Vocabulary](https://cc-vocabulary.netlify.app/) is CC's web design system. We'd like to build a really robust usage guide for Vocabulary so that anyone wanting to build a site using Vocabulary knows what components are available, how to use them, how to manage the build process, etc.
---
expected_outcome:
* Published usage guidelines for all components of Vocabulary that complement the existing storybook.
* A better landing page for Vocabulary, Vue Vocabulary, and Fonts.
* Integrated documentation for all three components of Vocabulary.
* Documentation and landing page should also use Vocabulary.
---
internship_tasks:  
* Work with CC's web/frontend developers and Vocabulary core committers to come up with a plan for the documentation.
* Write documentation.
* Work with the CC team to deploy the documentation publicly.
---
application_tips:
* Demonstrate your familiarity with the codebase and existing documentation.
* Explain how you'd like to refactor or expand the documentation in detail.
