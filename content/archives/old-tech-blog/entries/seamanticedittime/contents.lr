My last task concerning [Semantic Media Wiki](http://semantic-mediawiki.org) was to create an extension which adds automatically the " _Revision Time_ " and the _"Revision User_ " of a wiki page in the semantic data.

You can now use these data to sort querries, for example :
    
    
    { {#ask: [[Category:Task]]
    | sort=Revision time
    | order=descending
    | limit=3
    } }
    

It's currently used in the [Casestudies page ](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Casestudies)of the CC wiki.

You'll find the code and the instructions in the [Creative Commons Git repository](http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit?r=SemanticEditTime.git). This small piece of code is more a hack than a real extension. The semantic properties are supposed to be rewritten in the next version of Semantic MediaWiki, which will enable much easier user-defined special properties.
