Hubert Figuiere has [released Exempi 1.99.3](http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2007/07/10/540-exempi-1993)

An important addition in this release is the ability to serialize XMP to a string, making sidecar XMP possible. The soon-to-be-released [Liblicense](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense) 0.1 already takes advantage of this feature; it uses Exempi to read and write licenses within XMP sidecar.

Hopefully, the API will soon stabilize in preparation for the 2.0 release.
