We've discovered that some of our websites, in particular those that rely on MySQL, are very sensitive to spikes in disk I/O load. Right now, we do run some non-interactive services on the same machines as some of our websites.

Subversion and git in particular seem to cause long-duration high disk load, which causes Nathan Kinkade to get paged when e.g. wiki.creativecommons.org takes too long to load. We have found that using [ionice to set](http://friedcpu.wordpress.com/2007/07/17/why-arent-you-using-ionice-yet/) background activities to "idle" priority is very useful in avoiding sending text messages to NK.

However, ionice can only be run by root, meaning regular users can't even request the system be more gentle. So I wrote a simple tool, "ionicer," that is a setuid-root C tool that sets its parent process's IO priority to idle.

You [can check it out in my gitweb](http://git.asheesh.org/?p=ionicer.git;a=summary).

I then used [dpkg-divert](http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/118) to replace /usr/bin/svnserve and /usr/bin/git with simple shell wrappers that call ionicer before calling the real binaries. So the call path goes:

  * user connects with svn+ssh to code.creativecommons.org
  * user logs in with an SSH key and executes "svnserve."
  * svnserve is really a shell script. /bin/bash runs a script which does two things: 
    1. Runs ionicer, which changes the shell to I/O priority class idle, and
    2. Executes svnserve.real with the same arguments as were passed into the wrapper.



Ta-da!
