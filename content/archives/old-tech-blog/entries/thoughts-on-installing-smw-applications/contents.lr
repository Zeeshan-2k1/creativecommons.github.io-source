I've posted a follow up to my [previous notes](/archives/old-tech-blog/entries/mediawiki-the-application-platform/) on Semantic MediaWiki as an application platform. Installation and upgrade matters for an application; an [expanded brainstorm on how that might work](http://yergler.net/blog/2010/01/25/thoughts-on-deploying-and-maintaining-smw-applications/) is available on my blog.
