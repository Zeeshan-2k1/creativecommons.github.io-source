As you may know, I am working on this project as part of the Google Summer of Code program. Before starting, Fran√ßois Dechelle was already engaged and now we are joining efforts to develop this potentially-popular application!

The current state of the prototype is already adding the licenses in the body of the document.

After the license have been chosen, it becomes available as an Auto-Text, being able to be easily replicable in the document without having to create a new wizard. The name of the license and the URL are also being stored in the document' metadata.

Currently I am working on a weird bug which is not allowing the ooo API to retrieve some images of the available licenses at http://i.creativecommons.org/l/ (it was working perfectly few days ago...)

We're going to commit a stable version ready for download in the next weeks, but if you are eager to use it you can check out this folder at cctools repository:

[./ccooo/](http://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cctools/ccooo/)

Feedbacks and suggestions are welcome!

Cheers
