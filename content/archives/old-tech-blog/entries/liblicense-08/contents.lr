Brown paper bag release: liblicense claims that the RDF predicate for a file's license is http://creativecommons.org/ns#License rather than http://creativecommons.org/ns#license. Only the latter is correct.

Any code compiled with liblicense between 0.6 and 0.7.1 (inclusive) contains this mistake.

This time I have audited the library for other insanities like the one fixed here, and there are none. Great thanks to Nathan Yergler for spotting this. I took this chance to change ll_write() and ll_read() to *NOT* take NULL as a valid predicate; this makes the implementation simpler (and more correct).

Sadly, I have bumped the API and ABI numbers accordingly. It's available in SourceForge at http://sf.net/projects/cctools, and will be uploaded to Debian and Fedora shortly (and will follow from Debian to Ubuntu).

I'm going to head to Argentina for a vacation and Debconf shortly, so there'll be no activity from on liblicense for a few weeks. I would **love** help with liblicense in the form of further unit tests. Let's squash those bugs by just demonstrating all the cases the license should work in.
