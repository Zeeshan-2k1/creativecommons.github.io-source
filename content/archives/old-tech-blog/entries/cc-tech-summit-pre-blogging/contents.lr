CC's awesome interns (and perhaps others) will be live blogging the [tech summit](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Creative_Commons_Technology_Summit_2008-06-18) tomorrow, but panelist (and long time CC friend and innovator) Rob Kaye has a pre-blog -- [Thoughts on Copyright Registries](http://mayhem-chaos.net/blog/archives/001162.html).
