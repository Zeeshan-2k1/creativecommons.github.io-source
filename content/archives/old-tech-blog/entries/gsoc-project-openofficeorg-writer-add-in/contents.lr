Hi there!

I also was selected for the Google Summer of Code with this project mentored by Nathan R. Yergler. An introduction about the project:

> The goal of this project is to provide a tool for supporting the process of licensing documents. [Microsoft Office has a Creative Commons plug-in](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Microsoft_Office_Addin) to put licenses metadata in its documents. I propose a similar [Creative Commons add-in for OpenOffice.org](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/OpenOfficeOrg_Addin) that would allow license information to be embedded in OpenOffice.org documents. Despite being a requested feature for OpenOffice.org for more than two years, nothing has materialized. Having a simple way to add Creative Commons licenses will help to spread those licenses much more broadly. Making licenses available as Autotext for example, is one way this can be reached.

At first moment, I will concentrate on OOo Writer plugin, but of course, I have plans to extend this functionality to Calc and Impress as well. Get the full proposal [here](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~cam2/soc2007proposal.txt). If you have any suggestion, please let me know.

Let me introduce myself. My name is Cassio Melo, I'm 22 old and I live in Recife, Brazil. I'm an undergraduate at the same university of Alan Kelon ([Informatics Center](http://www.cin.ufpe.br), [Federal University of Pernambuco](http://www.ufpe.br)). 

Beyond my passion for Computer Science, I also have interests in Business and Economy. [Eric Drexler](http://www.e-drexler.com/p/idx04/00/0404drexlerBioCV.html) and [Clayton Christensen](http://www.claytonchristensen.com/) are my preferred authors.

I did work for a summer in my undergraduate course at Federal University of Pernambuco with the [SimPLe](https://simple.dev.java.net/), which is an open source software factory using Product Line approach for action games domain.

This year, I developed an OOo plugin to replace the existing OOo notes. Public distribution will begin in the near future.

Additionally I have a year of industrial experience, having worked as a software engineer on [C.E.S.A.R](http://www.cesar.org.br), developing a [tool](http://wdbc2006.cesar.org.br/wp-content/uploads/23959.pdf) (codenamed BART project) for software components search and retrieval. We also have developed plugins for Eclipse, MS Word and OpenOffice.org for supporting artifacts searching. As a member of the [R.i.S.E](http://www.rise.com.br) group, I've worked on algorithms for ranking software components.

You can view my full profile [here](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~cam2/info/english).

Finally, I would like to share the thanks with my friends. We hope to bring new energy and enthusiasm to CC projects. :)
