A number of months ago CC launched [a simplification](/archives/old-tech-blog/entries/one-click-paypal-donations-with-civicrm/) of the donation process on the [CC contribution page](https://support.creativecommons.org/donate). At that time, only PayPal was supported, but I'm happy to announce that Google Checkout support was recently integrated. The only change to the actual interface is that now a query string variable of **&pp; =** (pp = payment processor) is required.
