Carolina Botero (of CC Colombia and now CC regional manager for Latin America) has posted a [brief analysis of CC license use in Latin America](http://www.openbusinesslatinamerica.org/wp/2011/08/08/%C2%BFcomo-se-usan-las-licencias-creative-commons-en-latinoamerica/) ([es2en machine translation](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.openbusinesslatinamerica.org%2Fwp%2F2011%2F08%2F08%2F%25C2%25BFcomo-se-usan-las-licencias-creative-commons-en-latinoamerica%2F)).

As with [previous](http://web.si.umich.edu/tprc/papers/2007/805/CreateCommExp.pdf) looks at CC licenses across different jurisdictions and [regions](http://www.slideshare.net/gcheliotis/assessing-cc-adoption-in-asia-manila), this one is based on search engine reported links to jurisdiction "ported" versions of licenses. It is great to see what researchers have done with this limited mechanism.

I am eager to explore other means of characterizing CC usage across regions and fields, and hope to provide more [data](/archives/old-tech-blog/entries/available-for-analysis/) that will enable researchers to do this. This will be increasingly important as we attempt to forge a universal license that does not call for porting in the same way, with version 4.0 [over](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Global_Summit_2011) the coming year (as well as with the increasing [importance](https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/28525) of CC in the world).
