As title might suggest, i have been selected for [GSoC 2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/). As mentor for this [project](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Flickr_Image_Re-Use_for_OpenOffice.org) has been assigned [Nathan Yergler](http://creativecommons.org/about/people/#31).

The developing will focus on 3 key functionalities:

  * ability to search photos by tags
  * filter search results by license attributes
  * insert the image into the document along with attribution information



The first 2 steps were done(of course, this will not be the final version) in small [demo ](http://students.info.uaic.ro/~mhusleag/FlickrOOPlugin.oxt)that i attached to my application for [GSoC 2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/). The [OpenOffice ](http://www.openoffice.org/)components for which the extension will be implemented are Writer, Impress and Calc.

The application will be written in [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_language), using [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org/) with its plugin [OpenOffice NetBeans Integration](http://www.netbeans.org/community/magazine/html/03/openoffice/).

A short introduction : I`m Mihai Husleag, 24 years old, student in [Computer Science](http://www.infoiasi.ro/bin/Main/?language=en), at [Alexandru Ioan Cuza University](http://www.uaic.ro/uaic/bin/view/Main/?language=en) of [Iasi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iasi), [Romania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania). My previous experience as programmer is more related to the .NET framework. Another thing about me, if in the weekends i`m not reachable then its a high probability that you will find me [here](http://picasaweb.google.com/muntomanul1/PiatraCraiului/photo#5144739821863831250).

If you have any suggestions about this project(new functionalities, things you don't like, etc) feel free to leave a comment.
