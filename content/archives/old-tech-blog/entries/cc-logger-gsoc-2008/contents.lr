Before I dive-in on what CC-Logger is all about, a small intro to who I am:

My name is [Ankit Guglani](http://ankitguglani.wordpress.com "Ankt Guglani"), and I am an undergrad at Singapore Management University [[link](http://sis.smu.edu.sg "SMU")]. I has been working on a research project called 'CC-Monitor' Since 2006 under the supervision of prof. Giorgos Cheliotis. This was my introduction to Creative Commons, I have been working on Collecting and Compiling CC-Metrics since.

This summer is again blessed with the [Google, Summer of Code [GSoC]](http://code.google.com/opensource/gsoc/2008/faqs.html "Google Summer of Code - FAQ"). Yes, just like last year, Creative Commons [CC] is one of the mentoring organizations yet again. This time around there are 4 active CC-GSoC Projects; Here's what my GSoC project with CC [named CC-Logger] is all about.

The project aims to uncover the hidden metrics in the CC Logs. So I'll take look at the following logs (which are tucked away in an Amazon S3 account):

1) logs for creativecommons.org/license  
2) logs for i.creativecommons.org and creativecommons.org/images/licenses  
3) logs of creativecommons.org/licenses  
4) logs for search.creativecommons.org

Looking at these I hope to find additional information about CC usage such as switching patterns and click-through rates to the deeds, and then analyze and interpret these results. I also hope to come up with some indices / metrics that can be used as indicative predictors for trends.

I know, you're thinking it's summer of CODE, and this is all analysis, where is the code? Once I am done with coming up with metrics and indices, I get to code to automate the calculation (and possibly the web-publishing of the results) for all the future logs.

The fun part about this project is, the logs I need to analyze right now, are over 100 GB in size. I am so looking forward to having a local copy of that!

That's all for now, thanks to prof. Giorgos for getting me into CC, Mike for suggesting looking at the logs and of course Asheesh, for the mentoring. (-:
