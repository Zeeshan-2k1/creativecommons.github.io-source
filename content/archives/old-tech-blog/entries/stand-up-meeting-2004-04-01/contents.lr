The Tech Team at Creative Commons has recently replaced our weekly one-on-ones (myself with each direct report) with semi-weekly [stand-up meetings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) for the entire team. Note that we're not really agile "purists" -- our meeting involve some discussion of priorities, etc, either for the week ahead, or as a recap of the week past.

From Tuesday's meeting:
