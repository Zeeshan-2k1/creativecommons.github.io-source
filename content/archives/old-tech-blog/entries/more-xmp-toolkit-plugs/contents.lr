In a follow-up to [Mike's post about XMP](/archives/old-tech-blog/entries/dobe-xmp-toolkit-411-under-bsd/), [I](http://creativecommons.org) (through CC) have been working with [Adobe XMP's product manager](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/xmptoolkit/), [Gunar Penikis](http://blogs.adobe.com/gunar/), on how CC and Adobe can work together on XMP. Also, in the same line, I'm friends with and working with [Cyrille Berger](http://cyrilleberger.blogspot.com/2007/05/thanks-to-adobe-for-freeing-xmp.html) and [Hubert Figuiere](http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2007/05/11/518-thanks-you-adobe-for-xmp), who have [each](http://cyrilleberger.blogspot.com/2007/05/thanks-to-adobe-for-freeing-xmp.html) [noted](http://www.figuiere.net/hub/blog/?2007/05/11/518-thanks-you-adobe-for-xmp) how positive of a step releasing XMP SDK/Toolkit under a BSD license is for the larger community.

I'm having some other discussions with all the above mentioned folks with regards to how this is going to pan out, but all I can say is that it is going to encouage [XMP](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/XMP) to flourish, and return help smooth out metadata and embedding across the board.

This really frees up the space for more developments
