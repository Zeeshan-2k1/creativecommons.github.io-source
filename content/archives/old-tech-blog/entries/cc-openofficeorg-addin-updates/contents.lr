Hello all,

updates of the version 0.0.2:

* Creative Commons menu became visible in Calc and Impress

Although it's is not working properly yet, the addin is now supporting the other ooo applications.

* License Image bug fixed

Now the addin is retrieving the licenses images perfectly!

* Display dialog when opening licensed documents

A simple dialog box is shown when a CC licensed document is opened.

* Checks if the document is already licensed and warns the user

Something like "You have chosen a different license, do you want to proceed anyway?"

... serveral other minor-updates were made in the addin.

Take a look at the screen shots!

Want to try? Just download the [ccooo.oxt](http://cctools.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cctools/ccooo/trunk/ccooo/dist/) file and install it from Extension Manager in OpenOffice.Org!

Next steps:

* Internationalization support; 
* Exception handling (including timeout);
* Some changes on GUI, such as adding progress bars;
* Settings menu?
* Work on the same functionalities in Calc and Impress.
