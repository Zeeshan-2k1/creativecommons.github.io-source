Today I released [wpLicense](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/WpLicense) 0.7.6 ( ~~download~~ see update below). It's a minor bug fix, but one worth noting. Thanks to Tiago and CristÃ³bal for both reporting the bug.

The bug was simple: the [documentation](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/WpLicense_Function_Reference) says that the `licenseUri` function returns the URI of the selected license. And that's what the internal wpLicense code relied on. However, the implementation actually `echo`'d the URI, introducing a race condition: if things were timed _just right_ , the problem wasn't apparent. But too often they weren't, and then it was.

There are some outstanding issues with wpLicense, particularly with rendering the selection interface under Internet Explorer. That's just one of the tasks new [web engineer](http://creativecommons.org/about/opportunities#web) will be tackling when he or she comes on board. Which reminds me, we're still accepting resumes.

**UPDATE:** Yeah, so 0.7.6 only had half the fix; well, the entire fix, but I was braindead with the default parameter value. So I give you [0.7.6.1](http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/software/wplicense/download/wplicense-0.7.6.1.zip).
