Terry Hancock, a frequent poster on the law-oriented cc-licenses list, is working on an interesting metadata library called [Palimpsest](http://light-princess.org/palimpsest/):

> [W]hich has a mnemonic association with what the program does, and does have a clever backronym for those who want one:  
>  **P** ython  
>  **A** ttribution &  
>  **L** icensing  
>  **I** nformation  
>  **M** etadata  
>  **P** rocessor, with  
>  **S** ystematic  
>  **E** xtensibility for  
>  **S** undry  
>  **T** ypes

Terry's goals for the project:

  * Read/write support of Adobe XMP embedded metadata
  * Read/write support of native â€œnamed fieldâ€ data
  * Read/write support of comments
  * Read/write support of visible text labelling for formats that need it
  * General adaptation to the 15 Dublin Core named fields for all data
  * Discovery of attribution and licensing data in comments and annotations, if not available elsewhere
  * License-aware processing (expansion of common abbreviations of terms, etc)
  * Open-ended pluggable support for virtually any multimedia datatype
  * Highly portable, so that it can be used on clients or servers on any operating system
  * Dead-simple, so people will actually want to _use_ it



I'm glad to see Terry tackling this project. It'll be hard to get the abstractions right, but valuable if it works.

I love the project logo:  
[![Palimpsest logo](pal_logo.jpg)](http://light-princess.org/palimpsest/ "Palimpsest logo")  
Not because it is a particularly great logo, but because it's the first logo I've seen that could be mistaken for a captcha. Intentional or not, bound to be independently invented many times, and perhaps copied by me at least once.
