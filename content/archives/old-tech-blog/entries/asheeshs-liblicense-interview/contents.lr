Relatively to the [liblicense 0.8 announcement](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8748), I recently made a video interview of Asheesh concerning his work on [liblicense](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Liblicense).

Watch it [here](http://blip.tv/file/1142312/).

In his demo, Asheesh uses liblicense twice:

  * in the online photo gallery to read and write metadata
  * in the Eye Of Gnome plug-in to read license metadata



This shows that liblicense is now mature enough to be used by your applications.
