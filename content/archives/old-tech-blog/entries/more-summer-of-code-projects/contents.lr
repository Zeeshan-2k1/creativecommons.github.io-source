Nathan [blogged the five accepted Creative Commons/Science Commons projects](/archives/old-tech-blog/entries/summer-of-code-projects/).

There's also at least one CC-related SoC project being mentored by another oganization: [ccHost/Inkscape integration](http://code.google.com/soc/inkscape/appinfo.html?csaid=C7DF84C10F57F82D) by Bruno LuÃ­s GonÃ§alves Dilly, mentored by Bryce Harrington for the Inkscape project. Bruno was a CC SoC student last year and Bryce just completed a contract project for CC...

It's also worth noting three of the proposals we would have loved to accept, if only Google had given us eight slots instead of five (no complaints!):

  * An OpenOffice plugin for finding and importing CC licensed content (see [ThinkFree's implementation](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7204), contrast with the accepted OO.o project to CC license OO.o documents, similar to the [MS Office Addin](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Microsoft_Office_Addin)).
  * A CC licensing module for Gallery2.
  * CC census, extending our adoption statistics project.



Many other projects are outlined on the [CC developer challenge pages](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developer_Challenges). Sorry only five could be accepted with Google financial support!
