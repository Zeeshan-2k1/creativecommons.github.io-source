Some of these could turn out to be interesting for describing licensed content on the web, all rather interesting.

[hAudio](http://microformats.org/wiki/audio-info-proposal) proposed microformat.

Proposed [hAudio to RDFa mapping](http://wiki.digitalbazaar.com/en/HAudio_RDFa).

[RDFa-deployed Multimedia Medata](http://sw.joanneum.at/rammx/) (ramm.x) may be an effort to map and standardize use of existing and upcoming media description standards in RDFa ... I had to skim "ramm.x in 10 sec" and "what ramm.x is NOT" a few times to gather that, but the key description on that page seems to be:

> Does ramm.x replace RDF-based multimedia vocabularies, as, e.g., the [Music Ontology Specification](http://musicontology.com/)?
>      No! ramm.x aims at bringing existing formats, as MPEG-7 and the like, into the Semantic Web. It acts as a bridge using a [certain formalisation](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/mmsem/XGR-vocabularies/#formal) of an existing vocabulary.

Getting a bit more esoteric, [Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER)](http://www.w3.org/TR/powder-grouping/):

> facilitates the publication of descriptions of multiple resources such as all those available from a Web site.

Which is a bit of an understatement.
