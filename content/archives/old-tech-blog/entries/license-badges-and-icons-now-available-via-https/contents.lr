Prompted by a [nudge](http://identi.ca/notice/21809109) from [Evan Prodromou](http://evan.prodromou.name/), license badges and icons are now available via HTTPS on i.creativecommons.org. If you run a site available via HTTPS and use CC license badges or icons served from i.creativecommons.org, then you can now pull those images via HTTPS to avoid your users receiving a message from their browser that some of the page content is not encrypted.
