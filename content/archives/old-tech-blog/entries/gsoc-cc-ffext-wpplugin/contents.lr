Undoubtedly, it's very important for all GSoC student projects (and all projects under CC in general) to collaborate smoothly. A few days ago Nils Dagsson Moskopp, the developer of GSoC CC WordPress plugin, asked me to test the plugin to work with the extension for Firefox web browser I'm developing.

Today, releasing [version 0.7.0](http://code.creativecommons.org/viewgit/cc.ff_ext.git/plain/cc.ff_ext.xpi) of the extension, I recorded a [short screencast](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_px-jKy_YE&hd=1) (watch on YouTube), showing how the extension interprets RDFa information of the WordPress plugin [test page](http://gsoc2010.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/?p=45).

I hope this video would make us believe we're on the right way. ;)
